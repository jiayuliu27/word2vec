99999_999	Can movies think? This is a longstanding critical question, usually answered in the negative. Literature, the thinking goes, is uniquely able to show us the flow of thought and feeling from within, but the camera&rsquo;s eye and the two-dimensional screen can&rsquo;t take us past the external signs of consciousness. We can look at faces in various configurations of pleasure or distress, but minds remain invisible, mysterious, beyond the reach of cinema. One of the many accomplishments of &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; — a thrilling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios after a few years of commercially successful submasterpieces — is that it demolishes this assumption. The movie, directed by Pete Docter, solves a thorny philosophical problem with the characteristically Pixaresque tools of whimsy, sincerity and ingenious literal-mindedness. The story takes place mostly in the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), who has just moved with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) from Minnesota to San Francisco. What happens to Riley on the outside is pretty standard: a dinner-table argument with Mom and Dad; a rough day at school; a disappointing hockey tryout. But anyone who has been or known a child Riley&rsquo;s age will understand that such mundane happenings can be the stuff of major interior drama. The real action — the art, the comedy, the music and the poetry — unfolds among Riley&rsquo;s personified feelings. There is an old literary tradition of turning what used to be called the Passions into characters, and &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; updates this tradition with brilliant casting. Riley&rsquo;s brain is controlled by five busy, contentious emotions: Fear, Anger, Disgust, Sadness and Joy. Each one has a necessary role to play, and they all carry out their duties in Riley&rsquo;s neurological command center with the bickering bonhomie of workplace sitcom colleagues. Their voices, aptly enough, belong to a television-comedy dream team. Anger, a squat, inverted trapezoid of bright red bluster, is the &ldquo;Daily Show&rdquo; ranter Lewis Black. Disgust, a green mean girl, is the great Mindy Kaling. Fear, an elastic-limbed goofball, is the former &ldquo;Saturday Night Live&rdquo; rubber man Bill Hader. Sadness speaks in the sighing monotone of Phyllis Smith, the most reliable killjoy on &ldquo;The Office.&rdquo; She is blue and slow-moving, and the others sometimes wonder what exactly her job is supposed to be. But Joy reigns supreme. Even without an organizational chart, you can tell she&rsquo;s the boss. She&rsquo;s a sparkling whirlwind of positive energy and friendly micro-management. You might say she&rsquo;s the Leslie Knope of the cerebral cortex, and not only because her peppy vocalizations belong to Amy Poehler. In her long run as Leslie on &ldquo;Parks and Recreation,&rdquo; Ms. Poehler was frequently and hilariously annoying without ever ceasing to be likable. She performs a similar feat here, to a wonderfully subversive end. We start out rooting for Joy, primed by the Disney logo before the opening titles and the presence of young children in the neighboring seats. We want them — and Riley, and everyone — to be happy. But the insistence on happiness has its discontents. As a manager, Joy is focused above all on controlling and containing Sadness. She thinks she needs to keep her gloomy co-worker&rsquo;s hands off Riley&rsquo;s core memories. These golden, shiny orbs will be ruined if they turn blue. At one point, Joy draws a small chalk circle on the floor and instructs Sadness to stand inside it, not touching anything lest she wreck the upbeat mood. That&rsquo;s a pretty powerful metaphor for repression, of course, and &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; turns a critical eye on the way the duty to be cheerful is imposed on children, by well-intentioned adults and by the psychological mechanisms those grown-up authorities help to install. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my happy girl?&rdquo; Riley&rsquo;s parents are fond of saying when she seems down, and the forced smile that results is quietly heartbreaking. Not that Riley&rsquo;s mother and father are bad people. We see that their own heads are just as crowded as hers. They also have their own external worries and stresses, including a new house, a fledgling business and a child on the brink of momentous changes. Those unfold in a mental landscape that ranks among Pixar&rsquo;s grandest visual triumphs, up there with the coral reef in &ldquo;Finding Nemo,&rdquo; the post-apocalyptic garbage dump in &ldquo;Wall-E&rdquo; and thesinister day care center in &ldquo;Toy Story 3.&rdquo; The studio&rsquo;s earlier features have often served as demonstrations of technical breakthroughs. Pixar animators conquered water and piscine movement in &ldquo;Nemo,&rdquo; metal in &ldquo;Cars,&rdquo; fur in &ldquo;Monsters, Inc.&rdquo; and flight in &ldquo;Up.&rdquo; The achievement of &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; is at once subtler and more impressive. This is a movie almost entirely populated by abstract concepts moving through theoretical space. This world is both radically new — you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it — and instantly recognizable, as familiar aspects of consciousness are given shape and voice. Remember your imaginary childhood friend? Your earliest phobias? Your strangest dreams? You will, and you will also have a newly inspired understanding of how and why you remember those things. You will look at the screen and know yourself. I would gladly catalog the movie&rsquo;s wittiest inventions and sharpest insights, or try to draw a word map of Riley&rsquo;s brain. Nothing would be spoiled. But I&rsquo;ll leave you the pleasure of discovery, noting only that you should keep an ear out for Michael Giacchino&rsquo;s music and Richard Kind&rsquo;s voice, and your eye peeled for sly philosophical sight gags.
99999_998	The new Pixar animation Inside Out could easily have been called Out There. It&rsquo;s as bizarre, imaginative and authentically psychedelic as anything produced in mainstream animation. At this point in the fortunes of the once-infallible creative powerhouse, you wouldn&rsquo;t have bet on Pixar coming up with anything very outré. Bought by Disney in 2006, the studio hadn&rsquo;t produced anything truly inspired that wasn&rsquo;t a sequel since Upin 2009. Given the humdrum quality of Cars 2and Monsters University and 2012&rsquo;s well-intentioned but forgettable Brave, it seemed as if the studio had lost its penchant for exotic risk. But Inside Out is in the top rank of Pixar productions with its combination of audacity, intelligence, wit and emotional reward. Directed and co-written by Pete Docter (Monsters, Incand Up) and co-directed by Ronnie del Carmen, Inside Outstarts from a boldly abstract premise: the narrative plays out within the psyche of a girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) and the film&rsquo;s characters are her feelings.
	At the start, one of those feelings, Joy (Amy Poehler), asks: &ldquo;Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head?&rdquo; The next questions that arise are: what might such psychic events actually look like? And how might they generate a story that can be sustained for 102 minutes? Inside Out meets these challenges with an inventiveness that&rsquo;s appropriately mind-boggling. Formidably ingenious, Inside Out hits an elusive sweet spot in appealing to children and adults alike. The film starts in a dark cavern, the Plato&rsquo;s cave of the unformed self. As baby Riley is born, Joy spontaneously appears – a shimmering, big-eyed Tinkerbell-like pixie – and observes Riley&rsquo;s view of the world on a glowing, cloud-like surveillance screen. Joy is soon joined by other emotions – Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger, the latter characterised as a squat red sponge that bursts into flame when provoked. These five monitor Riley&rsquo;s life and produce her responses by operating a console of levers and buttons, something between the USS Enterprise and PlayStation 4. Inside Out explores much the same premise – little people busy working in your head – as the Beano&rsquo;s Numskulls strip, but it&rsquo;s infinitely more sophisticated and distinctively female-skewed. The film&rsquo;s real heroine is Joy, a pathologically upbeat micro-manager convinced that only positive feelings count – and Amy Poehler instils Joy with something of the obsessive girl guide eagerness of her Leslie Knope in the TV sitcom Parks and Recreation. Then crisis comes as Riley, now 11, moves with her parents (Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan) from Minnesota to scary San Francisco, where a new school fills her with anguish and where, worst of all, pizzas come topped with broccoli. The ensuing narrative is set in the far reaches of Riley&rsquo;s psychic landscape – and it is a landscape. Her trauma triggers the seismic collapse of the &ldquo;personality islands&rdquo; – literally, floating landmasses – that define who she is, devoted to such themes as family, friendship and hockey. A control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness wandering in a vast allegorical geography that includes such landmarks as imagination (a theme park) and the place where dreams are made: a movie studio, of course, where productions range from I&rsquo;m Falling Down a Very Deep Pit to Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7. In the film&rsquo;s wildest moment, the wanderers enter a zone of abstract thought, where they are zapped into a series of increasingly simplified geometric shapes, as they – and the film itself – dizzyingly self-deconstruct (&ldquo;Oh no, we&rsquo;re non-figurative!&rdquo;). Formidably ingenious, Inside Out hits an elusive sweet spot in terms of appealing to children and adults alike. It makes extraordinary use of knowing cuteness, for example. Take Bing Bong, Riley&rsquo;s long-lost imaginary friend from early childhood, a cat-elephant hybrid made out of candyfloss. Here, the film seems to stray perilously into Jar Jar Binks territory – but while smaller children will warm to Bing Bong as a cuddly oddity, adults and older kids will see something quite troubling in a figure that&rsquo;s manifestly a primitive creation of the infant mind, poignantly fated to extinction. It&rsquo;s in the way that the story depicts the fading of childhood&rsquo;s mental furniture, and explores the mechanics of forgetting, that Inside Out achieves a universal significance. While specialists may bemoan the simplicity of the film&rsquo;s mental model, inspired by the &ldquo;psychoevolutionary&rdquo; theory of Robert Plutchik, the eventual message – that sorrow is as valuable an emotion as happiness – is delivered with less piety than you might imagine. As for the visual style, it&rsquo;s dazzling, flouting CGI&rsquo;s tendency to photorealism in favour of overt cartoonishness in a 1950s retro vein, together with a refined exploration of light: the emotions are composed of fibrous bundles of luminescence. The running gags are delicious (don&rsquo;t miss the end credits), and in the best Pixar fashion, Inside Out expertly but uncynically tugs the heartstrings – and indeed, the film&rsquo;s theme overtly shows you how it&rsquo;s done. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to come out of Inside Out wiping a tear from your eye: you can always say: &ldquo;It was the little people in my head that did it.&rdquo;
